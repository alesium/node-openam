node-openam
===========
A simple API for node.js to use OpenAM's (http://forgerock.com/openam.html) RESTfull API. The main purpose of this library was to implement it for Passport (http://passportjs.org/), and it's implemented here (https://github.com/alesium/passport-openam).

Tested against OpenAM 9.5.1.
